                        In the world of web-development, 2 terms get thrown around referring to which section of development you are likely to be put in – 
                        these terms are: Front end and Back End developer. Although sounding like an innuendo, these terms actually refers to the area of 
                        development you are doing and the certain tasks you do making it hard to exactly pin point which category you are under but this is 
                        what I will explain in this page so you can decide for yourself (or learn something new if you're not a developer). <br/><br/>

                            Front End refers to developing the visible aspects of a website which involves programming languages like HTML and CSS. These 
                            developers are normally called Web designers as their utility is found in their ability to accurately picture what the client wants 
                            through in-depth analysis of the client’s criteria for the website and adequately producing what the client has envisioned. This work
                            is hard as communication skill is paramount which is something rare in programmers (including me) and these people must be creative 
                            and learned in aesthetic taste of all types of customer to be successful in what they do. <br/> <br/>

                        Back-End developers are the programmers that dwell in the servers and databases of the browser. These programmers are the people who 
                        we should thank for a stable and safe browsing environment. They deal with data security, structure and content management, basically 
                        the backbones of the browser. These developers are more systematic and more observant, thinking of all outcomes to a certain situation. <br/> <br/>
